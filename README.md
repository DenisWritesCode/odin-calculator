# The Odin Project Calculator Project.

## Project Specifications

1. Your calculator is going to contain functions for all of the basic math
   operators you typically find on simple calculators : _add, subtract, multply
   & divide_.
2. Operate on inputs when the user presses the “=” key.
3. Your calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a
   time. If you enter a number then an operator and another number that
   calculation should be displayed if your next input is an operator. The
   result of the calculation should be used as the first number in your new
   calculation.
4. You should round answers with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the screen.
5. Pressing “clear” should wipe out any existing data.. make sure the user is really starting fresh after pressing “clear”
6. Display an error when division by 0 is attempted.
